Function : Access – person/object/activity, Description of behaviours (include frequency, duration and severity) that align with this function: Full body slam [running into walls and other solid objects, forcefully connecting with head, torso and limbs together] and hitting head on solid objects [walls] and hitting staff with head [forward head-butt to staff head or shoulder area]. Before these behaviours occur, deep, he will show low vocalisations [humming progresses to grunting] and pacing [3 fast steps back and forth] and runs towards staff, wide eyes and hands fisted at sides, stiff body. Setting events, triggers and consequences related to these behaviours (add/remove rows as necessary): Setting events:[When Taylor has had a negative,interaction with co-tenant/s earlier in day,When Taylor has had schedule changes earlier in day,When Taylor is tired],Triggers:[Unsure of what is happening next] Consequences:[Access to support staff],A summary statement outlining the functional hypothesis: Taylor will make a deep humming/grunting noise and pace when he is unsure of what is happening next. Taylor does this to access staff support [the provision of information]. If staff do not respond to Taylor’s deep humming/grunting and pacing within two minutes and provide information on what is happening next, Taylor’s behaviour that causes harm to self or others will escalate and he will run towards and full body slam the closest large solid object and commence hitting head on that object. If staff do not respond to Taylor hitting his head and full body slam into solid objects within 30 seconds and provide information on what is happening next, Taylor will run towards staff, eyes wide, hands fisted at sides, stiff body and will hit staff in the head or shoulder area with his own head. This behaviour is more likely to occur if Taylor has had negative interaction with his cotenant/s. and/or there are changes to his schedule earlier in the day, and/or he is tired.Proposed alternative or functionally equivalent replacement behaviour(s): Replace full body slam and hitting head behaviours with using a ‘next’ sign
