Taylor enjoys having a big glass of cold water \nwith ice after his outside activities.  Taylor lives with two other gentlemen who are significantly older than Taylor \nand who prefer to be inside rather than outside. Taylor does not seem to think being inside is much fun.  Taylor’s \nmother passed away when he was 21 and his father suffered a stroke shortly after the passing of his mother, at \nwhich time Taylor entered supported accommodation. Taylor has two older brothers [Tim and Jason] who take \nturns visiting Taylor once a month on a Saturday morning, sometimes taking Taylor [with staff support] to see his \ndad who is in a nursing home approximately two hours’ drive away.  It is uncertain if Taylor understands what has \nhappened to his parents, but he stopped signing for them after living in his home for a few months. Taylor looks \nforward to seeing his brothers each month and will spend extra time in the back yard to make sure it is very tidy \nfor their visit.  Taylor enjoys going out, some of his favourite places to visit is the local park which has a gym \ncircuit, as well as basketball courts, soccer fields, the beach and bushwalking tracks.

Taylor has relaxed body language and posture when out with small groups.  Taylor is \ngenerally healthy, only experiencing minor colds once or twice a year.  Taylor is not fussy when it comes to food \nand enjoys eating the healthy foods that staff prepare for him. Taylor also drinks plenty of water which further \nsupports his health. As Taylor is constantly on the go, he has sufficient exercise daily to support his health and \nwellbeing. Taylor has damage to his frontal lobe that causes him to have short-term memory deficits.'}
